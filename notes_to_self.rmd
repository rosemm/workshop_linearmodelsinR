"Implicit contract with the computer / scripting language: Computer will do tedious computation for you. In return, you will be completely precise in your instructions. Typos matter. Case matters. Get better at typing." from http://stat545-ubc.github.io/block002_hello-r-workspace-wd-project.html


“To understand computations in R, two slogans are helpful:
Everything that exists is an object.
Everything that happens is a function call."
— John Chambers
